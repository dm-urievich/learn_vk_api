learn hove to use vkontakte API


how to use test_api.py (first file, I will change name...)
1) get access_token
uncomment 8-11 lines and run script, your browser will open pange, you have to copy access_token from url to function parameter in 18 line instead 'copy_token_here'
2) comment 8-11 lines again, token will work 24 hours
3) run script with command:
    ./test_api.py tag
where tag some word for search group
as output script will create two files in current directory with links to vk groups
in 20 line you can change number of groups for search, parameter 'count'
